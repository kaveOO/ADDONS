		WOS_ALCS.TRACE.MINIMAL		--Traces only occur when swinging/attacking, good for performance but removes burn damage and scorch
		WOS_ALCS.TRACE.INTERP		--Trace travels path of lightsaber. Useful for precision but a little more intensive
		WOS_ALCS.TRACE.MINIMALINTERP		--Same as INTERP, but following MINIMAL rules. Precision with a slightly reduced load

/*
	What is the threshold timing for networking sync to client?
	DO NOT EDIT THIS OUTSIDE OF THE SUGGESTIONS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DOES!
	The higher the number, the more optimized but less frequent the data will be checked
	Basically, we wait this much time before we do another network flag check. Ask in the support channel as there's a LOT of advantages
	for different maps (small, grouped maps will be better for less frequent network flags for example)

	Set to FALSE to auto calculate for your current tick rate (server-side and linear)

	Example: 0.35 seconds (optimized for 11 tick)
	Suggestions:
	   66 tick : 0.15 seconds
	   33 tick: 0.22 seconds
	   11 tick: 0.35 seconds
